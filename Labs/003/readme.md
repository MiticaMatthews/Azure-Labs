In this lab, I will walk you through the process of deploying an Ubuntu Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure using the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI). 

## Requirements 
1. **Azure Account:** If you don't already have an Azure subscription, create a free account using the following link: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/.
2. **Azure Cloud Shell:** You can launch and run the free interactive shell in the Azure portal. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.
3. **Azure CLI:** Alternatively, you can opt to use the terminal on your local machine. Ensure that Azure CLI is installed on your machine. Follow the official guidance on [How to Install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

I will be using the terminal on my local machine for this task.
